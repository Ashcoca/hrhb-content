Start with the [tic-tac-toe implementation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) provided in the official React documentation.

Fork [the final solution in Codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010) into your own fork.

1) Note how the `calculateWinner` function is hanging out in the global scope for no reason. Put it inside the class where it belongs.

2) Remove all cruft from the starter HTML and CSS that isn't needed for the game (that has no effect on gameplay).

3) Strip out **all** the "time travel" / history junk, from both the logic and the UI.

4) Convert the state data and the corresponding logic from being based on a 1-dimensional array to a 2-dimensional array.

5) Add a working `Reset Game` button.

6) Replace all the CSS with the following CSS (you've heard of [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/), right?) and change the DOM structure generated by the React code such that it works.

```css
body {
  font: 14px "Century Gothic", Futura, sans-serif;
  margin: 20px;
}

ol, ul {
  padding-left: 30px;
}

.status {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.square {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.game-board {
  display: grid;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  grid-template: repeat(3, 1fr) / repeat(3, 1fr);

  float: left;
  margin-right: 20px;
}

.game-info {
  float: left;
}
```

7) Add this animation CSS and use it to make the whole board spin, the 1st time someone wins. (Don't get hung up on making it spin more than once.)

```css
.rotate-center {
          animation: rotate-center 0.6s ease-in-out both;
}
@keyframes rotate-center {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```
