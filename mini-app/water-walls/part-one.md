## [Mini-app] Water Walls, Part 1

This is one variation of a commonly-asked interview problem.

Before diving into the specification, note a couple of logistical details.

## Time limit

End of day (5pm PST).

## Day 1 of a two-day problem

**Today**, you're going to write and verify pure JavaScript logic to solve this problem.

**Tomorrow**, you're going to wrap that logic inside a mini-app with a frontend and a backend, with more specification.

## Specification for part 1

We are going to represent a series of walls of different integer heights.

Given heights of `[5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2]`, it would look like this:

Now imagine that it rains.

Your goal is to determine which two walls have the most water trapped between them.

## Today's deliverable

The goal for today is a Github repo containing:

* a README containing your *setup notes* (just like the standalone single-function problems).
* a clean JavaScript logic implementation.
* Jest tests thoroughly verifying this logic
