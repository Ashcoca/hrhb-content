## [Mini-app] Water Walls, Part 2

## Time limit

A lot of time :) (9am PST the next business day).

## Day 2 of a two-day problem

**Yesterday**, you wrote and verified pure JavaScript logic to solve this problem.

**Today**, you're going to wrap that logic inside a mini-app with a frontend and a backend, with more specification.

## Specification for part 2

Your frontend should present a form that accepts a comma-separated list of integers representing wall heights.

Your backend processes this input into a data-only response payload (i.e., it doesn't send back HTML).

The frontend then processes the response payload into a nicely-rendered view of the walls and the water, as seen below.

The 2 walls that trap the most water between them should be "inked in" black.

Example output:

## Deliverables

The goal is to evolve your existing Github repo (from part 1) to contain:

* The README updated to contain an overview of the problem and installation instructions. Please keep your algorithmic / SFP-style setup explanation.
* A modularly-structured frontend. Please don't use React, use plain-vanilla client-side JavaScript.
    * Note: The frontend should use client-side JS modules.
    * The above colored-blocks output is an *exact* visual spec -- it should look exactly like this mock.
* A modularly-structured backend, using Node + Express.
