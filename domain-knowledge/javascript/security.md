# Browser security

## Same-origin and CORS

* [Same-origin policy](https://www.sitepoint.com/working-around-origin-policy/) -- good, short overview of what it is, and workarounds
* [Working With and Around the Same-Origin Policy](https://www.sitepoint.com/working-around-origin-policy/) -- Critical that you know about same-origin stuff, or you will be mystified when, for example, your web fonts specified in your CSS don't load sometimes.
* [Understanding CORS](https://spring.io/understanding/CORS) -- super-useful and in common use nowadays, e.g., by 3rd-party tracking services like Mixpanel and Amplitude, to ping their servers with events from your site.

## XSS etc

* [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/) Fun, free site with quick hits on all the common security holes. Don't spend a TON of time here at first, but do zip through the modules on XSS, CSRF, SQL injection.
