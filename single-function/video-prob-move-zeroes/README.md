## How to do the work

* No need to make tests, although a big bonus of course if you can get to this.

### [NEW!] Record your performance

* Record your performance in Zoom (or anything that will capture your desktop).
* You'll have to record locally, because we don't have enough cloud storage space... sowwy!

## Submitting your final code

* In Canvas, submit your Repl.it URL by the deadline.
* Upload your performance video to a Google Doc folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14lsfgjBl5Ss4K3bpXax_SBNZlrdNJht1](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14lsfgjBl5Ss4K3bpXax_SBNZlrdNJht1)

  <summary>Did you start recording?</summary>
  <p>This is the good old "move zeroes to the end" problem.

<p>Even if you have seen it before, it's fine.  We want to see how you process a problem, live.

<p>Given an array of integers, write a function to move all 0's to the end, while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

<p>For example, given <code>nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]</code>, after calling your function, nums should be <code>[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]</code>.</p>

<p>Note:

<p>    You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
<p>    Minimize the total number of operations.
